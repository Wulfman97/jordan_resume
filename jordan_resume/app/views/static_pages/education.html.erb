<p>I recently graduated from the University of Utah. I love learning about technology and got a Bachelor in Science in Electrical Engineering. After getting this degree, I decided to purse a career in software engineering. My love for programming started a year ago when I took courses at Salt Lake Community College, learning object-oriented programming and data structures. I'm currently enrolled in MongoDB University, this free online course teaches everything you need to know to build a MongoDB-based app using the Node.js driver. My current goals are to master Javascript and to became a software engineer.</p>
